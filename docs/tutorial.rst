Tutorial
========

This tutorial shows how to use Squirls to calculate SQURILS scores for all variants in a VCF file.


Setup
~~~~~
Follow the instructions in :ref:`rstsetup` to download the external files and to prepare Squirls executable. Most users
should download the pre-built version of Squirls available on the
`Releases <https://github.com/TheJacksonLaboratory/Squirls/releases>`_ page. However, we also provide instructions
for building Squirls from source if desired.
