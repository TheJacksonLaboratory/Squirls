# Sample file with definitions of splice donor and acceptor site positional weight matrices (PWM)
# '---' separates individual PWMs
# 2 required attributes are: [name, matrix]
# 	- name
#	- matrix - each line corresponds to position in evaluated sequence
#		- columns represent position weights for nucleotides in this order: A,C,G,U
# the matrix content will be loaded into DoubleMatrix by PositionalWeightMatrixParser
#

#
# The content of this PWM was calculated using InformationContent software by alignment of splice sites of all exons
# present in Jannovar RefSeq cache v0.21.
#
# The numbers represent frequencies of nucleotides at particular position
# of splice site.
