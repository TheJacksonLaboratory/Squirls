# Versioning

Squirls uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) rules to describe release versions. 
However, during the development, multiple labels that are not consistent with these rules were
used to denote a particular Squirls development step.

For instance, Squirls code base was at `v1.3.0-RC3` just before releasing the first public version.

This is to indicate that there might be multiple different commits within the VCS that indicate to 
version `v1.3.0`. The more recent commits should be regarded to as the correct commits.
